# Blazor Starter Application

# Introduction

Hello, my name is Aaron Jones and this is my Blazor website that I have created. This is also used for my COP 3003 project.

# Features
Home Page: Just a basic introduction to the website and all about me.
<br />
Counter: Counter included where when a user clicks a button, then the counter goes up by one. More types of counters may be implemented as well in the future.
<br />
Fetch Data: Receives weather forecast data from a server.
<br />
Todo: A basic todo list that users can customize and edit.
<br />
IPO: An input output feature where the user inserts a number and the output number is doubled. More types of IPOs may be implemented as well in the future.
<br />
There will be more features to come along as well but it's still a work in development.
