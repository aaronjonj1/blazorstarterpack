# Blazor Starter Application

# Introduction

Hello, my name is Aaron Jones and this is my Blazor website that I have created. This is also used for my COP 3003 project.

# Features
Home Page: Just a basic introduction to the website and all about me.
<br />
Counter: Counter included where when a user clicks a button, then the counter goes up by one. More types of counters may be implemented as well in the future.
<br />
Fetch Data: Receives weather forecast data from a server.
<br />
Todo: A basic todo list that users can customize and edit.
<br />
Calculator: A calculator tool where a user can insert two numbers and then choose whether they would like to add, subtract, multiply, or divide the numbers.
<br />
IPO Calculator: An input output feature where the user inserts a number and then they can decide whether it can be doubled, tripled, squared, or cubed.
<br />
BMI Calculator: A calculator that calculates your BMI based on your height in feet and inches and your weight in pounds.
<br />
Car Database: An example of a used car dealership database displaying information of the cars that are for sale.
<br />
Criminal Database: An example of a list of criminals which displays their basic information as long as the crimes on their records.
<br />
Inches to Centimeters: A calculator where the user puts a number displayed in inches and then converts the output to centimeters.
<br />
Convert Inches: A calculator where the user puts a number displayed in inches and then converts it to a unit that is provided.
<br />
Randomizer: A calculator that randomizes a value from a lower and upper value.

A lot of my tools that I use on this website have a good amount of user interaction with it, so have fun playing around with it.
There will be more features to come along as well but it's still a work in development.
